## 📚 **Java Core Labs Overview**
These labs focus on mastering **core Java programming** concepts, gradually building your problem-solving and development skills. Here’s a brief summary:

1. **Mathematical Operations**  
   🔢 Perform calculations using arrays, loops, and the Java `Math` library, practicing fundamental programming concepts.

2. **Pokémon Battle Simulation**  
   🦸 Learn about inheritance, polymorphism, and method overriding through an interactive Pokémon battle simulation.

3-4. **Object-Oriented Design and Scenario Simulation**  
   🎭 Design an object model based on a scenario using UML diagrams. Simulate object interactions with proper encapsulation, abstraction, and inheritance.

5. **Collection Manager**  
   📂 Manage a collection of objects stored in an XML file using the `LinkedList`. Implement commands to add, update, and delete entries interactively.

6. **Client-Server Application**  
   🌐 Extend the collection manager into a **TCP-based client-server application**. The server manages the collection, while the client sends and retrieves commands.

7. **Multi-Threaded Server with Database Integration**  
   💾 Replace file-based storage with a **PostgreSQL database**. Implement multi-threading and user-based access control using hashed passwords.

8. **Graphical User Interface with JavaFX**  
   🖥️ Replace the console client with a **JavaFX GUI**. Visualize the collection interactively and support internationalization for multiple languages.

## 🌐 **Java Web Labs Overview**
The **Java Web labs** introduce you to developing **dynamic web applications** with **servlets, JSP, FastCGI**, and modern frameworks like **JAX-RS** and **JSF**.

1. **FastCGI Server with AJAX**  
   🌍 Develop a **FastCGI server** in Java to process HTTP requests. Build an HTML page with **AJAX-based interactions** and dynamic updates.

2. **Servlets and JSP (MVC)**  
   🔄 Implement a web application following the **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern. Use servlets to handle backend logic and JSP for dynamic HTML generation.

3. **JavaServer Faces (JSF) Application**  
   🌐 Develop a **JSF-based web application** using managed beans and dynamic components. Store point-check results in a **PostgreSQL database**.

4. **RESTful Web Application (JAX-RS + Angular)**  
   🔗 Build a **RESTful API** using **JAX-RS** with JWT-based user authentication. The frontend is developed using **Angular 2+**, providing an interactive user experience.
